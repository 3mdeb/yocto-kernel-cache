Subject: [PATCH 279/310] iwlwifi: mvm: reset seq num after restart

commit 5d39051a328c0508b0fb0247227197059edd2da9 upstream.

After a FW reset on A000 NICs, the driver doesn't
set the seq number when re-allocating the queues.
This in turn leads to a mismatch between the seq
number the driver thinks each frame has, and the
actual seq num given by the HW.

This especially causes issues with aggregations,
since the driver could be waiting to start an
aggregation and queue traffic from the mac80211
until then, when actually it shouldn't be waiting.
