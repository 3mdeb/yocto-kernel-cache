Subject: [PATCH 059/252] timers: Introduce expiry spin lock

When del_timer_sync() is called, it is possible, that the CPU has to
spin, because the timer is marked as running. The function will
repeatedly try to delete the timer until the timer callback completes
and the function succeeds.
On a virtual machine this spinning can waste CPU cycles if the vCPU
invoking the timer callback is not scheduled by the host (and making no
progress).

The spinning and time wasting, could be prevented by using PARAVIRT_SPINLOCKS
and introducing a per timer base spin lock for expiry. The lock is hold during
expiring the timers of a base. When the deletion of a timer wasn't successful,
because the timer is running at the moment, the expiry lock is trying to
accessed instead of cpu_realax(). The lock is already held by the CPU expiring
the timers, so the CPU could be scheduled out instead of spinning until the lock
is released, because of the PARAVIRT_SPINLOCKS code. Thereby wasting time
spinning around is prevented.

The code isn't done conditionally on PARAVIRT_SPINLOCKS. The lock is taken only
at two places. In one of them the lock is directly dropped after accessing
it. So the probability for a slowpath when taking the lock is very low. But this
keeps the code cleaner than introducing several CONFIG_PARAVIRT_SPINLOCKS
dependend code paths and struct members.
