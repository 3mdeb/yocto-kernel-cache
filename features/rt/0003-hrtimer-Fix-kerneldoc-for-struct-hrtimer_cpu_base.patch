Subject: [PATCH 03/25] hrtimer: Fix kerneldoc for struct hrtimer_cpu_base

The sequence '/**' marks the start of a struct description. Add the
missing second asterisk. While at it adapt the ordering of the struct
members to the struct definition and document the purpose of
expires_next more precisely.
