Subject: [PATCH 064/298] x86/fpu: Only write PKRU if it is different from
 current

Dave Hansen says that the `wrpkru' is more expensive than `rdpkru'. It
has a higher cycle cost and it's also practically a (light) speculation
barrier.

As an optimisation read the current PKRU value and only write the new
one if it is different.
